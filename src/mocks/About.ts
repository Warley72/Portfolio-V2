    developing interfaces with React, Next.js, TypeScript, SASS, Tailwind, and Lua, for both web systems and
    games like FiveM. In addition, I maintain a finance app called PoupApp, which I use as a study and experimentation
    environment to apply the knowledge I have acquired in frontend and backend development, using technologies such as Node.js,
    Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma, JWT-based authentication, and API consumption. I am currently seeking to further enhance my skills
    and grow professionally in the market.`,
